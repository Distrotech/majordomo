QUICK DIGEST SETUP:

For the purpose of example, let's say that you have a majordomo list
called "banjo" and that you want to create "banjo-digest".

1.  You need to create two directories: the digest's work directory
	and the digest's archive directory.  They CAN'T be the same directory.

    Where should these directories be created?  Look in your majordomo.cf
    file to see how these three variables are defined: $digest_work_dir,
    $filedir, $filedir_suffix.  Let's say they look like this:

        $digest_work_dir = "/usr/local/mail/digest";
        $filedir = "/usr/local/mail/files";
        $filedir_suffix = ".archive";

    That being the case, you must create these two directories:

        /usr/local/mail/digest/banjo-digest
        /usr/local/mail/files/banjo-digest.archive

    The first is the work directory, the second is the archive directory.

    Make sure that majordomo has write permission on both directories.


2.  You must create a majordomo list called "banjo-digest".

    In most respects it is just like any ordinary list, but when you
    set up the configuration file (banjo-digest.config), you will
    have to configure these parameters:

        digest_issue = 1
        digest_name = Banjo Digest
        digest_volume = 1
        digest_maxdays =
        digest_maxlines =
        maxlength = 40000
        message_footer << END
        END
        message_fronter << END
        END

    Remember that these variables are in banjo-digest.config, NOT banjo.config.

    Also, do NOT touch the variables digest_archive, digest_rm_header, etc.

    Both digest_issue and digest_number should start at 1 unless you have
    some special reason to do otherwise.  The digest name should be an
    obvious choice, but don't make it longer than 24 characters.

    "maxlength" is the maximum size in characters (bytes) for a digest.
    "digest_maxlines" is the maximum number of lines in a digest.
    "digest_maxdays" is the maximum age in days of an article in a digest.

    The last two parameters are optional, but maxlength must be defined.
    A digest will automatically be created if any one of the three limits
    is exceeded.

    You can put this sort of material in the header or footer:

message_fronter << END
In this issue:
-
-    _SUBJECTS_
-
See the end of the digest for information about banjo-digest.
END

    Note that you need to indicate blank lines by placing a '-'
    character at the beginning of the line.  You also indicate
    whitespace at the beginning of a line by putting a '-' in
    front of the whitespace.

    The _SUBJECTS_ token will be expanded to all of the subject lines
    of the messages in the digest, one subject per line.

3.  Create some aliases.

    You need to add to the banjo-outgoing alias:

        banjo-outgoing: :include:/path/to/lists/banjo, banjo-digestify

    and then you need the banjo-digest aliases:

        banjo-digestify: "|/path/to/wrapper digest -r -C -l banjo-digest banjo-digest-outgoing"

        banjo-digest: banjo
        banjo-digest-outgoing: :include:/path/to/lists/banjo-digest
        owner-banjo-digest-outgoing: harry
        banjo-digest-approval: harry

4.  Add a cron job.

    If you want digests to be created at regular intervals, put this 
    line in your cron table:

        echo mkdigest banjo-digest pluck | mail majordomo@mj.server.com

    ("pluck" is the digest's password).

5.  Test it!
