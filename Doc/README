majordomo.lisa6.ps
	The original Majordomo paper from the USENIX LISA VI conference
	in October, 1992.  While this paper is somewhat out of date
	(some of the details about how Majordomo works have changed,
	and many of the items mentioned as "to be implemented later"
	have since been implemented), it remains a valuable
	introduction to Majordomo's basic form and structure.

list-owner-info
	has information for list owner to get them started using
	majordomo and the config files.


majordomo.ora
	This file is the chapter about Majordomo from the Nutshell Handbook
	"Managing Internet Information Services," written by Jerry Peek.
	The chapter is (c) Copyright 1994 by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.,
	and was included in the Majordomo distribution by permission of the
	publisher.

	This chapter is a good introduction to setting up the
	majordomo software, be warned that it does not cover much of
	the list operation details under 1.90 that deal with config
	files. Then again the config files are supposed to be self
	documenting. A newer version of this chapter that has been
	updated for 1.90 is in the works, and should make it into the
	"Managing Internet Information Services" book. This newer
	chapter should be available via ftp in due time. Stay tuned to
	the majordomo-announce or majordomo-users mailing list for
	details.
